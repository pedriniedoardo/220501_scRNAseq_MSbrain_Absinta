# # Use a Deconvolution Tool
# # Deconvolution tools are algorithms designed to estimate the cellular composition of bulk tissue using a single-cell dataset as a reference. Since your bulk sample is pure, you would expect the correct cell type to be predicted at nearly 100% proportion. This is a very strong form of validation.
# 
# # A great tool for this is Bisque. It's specifically designed to work with scRNA-seq data as a reference and is known to be robust.
# 
# # How to do it:
# # Convert your scRNA-seq Seurat object into an ExpressionSet object.
# 
# # Convert your bulk RNA-seq count matrix and metadata into an ExpressionSet object.
# 
# # Run the BisqueRNA::ReferenceBasedDecomposition function.
# 
# library(BisqueRNA)
# library(Biobase)
# 
# # 1. Create ExpressionSet for single-cell data
# # Use raw counts and ensure gene names match
# sc_counts <- GetAssayData(scobj, slot = "counts", assay = "RNA")
# sc_metadata <- scobj@meta.data
# # Ensure subject IDs are in the metadata for Bisque
# sc_eset <- ExpressionSet(assayData = as.matrix(sc_counts),
#                          phenoData = AnnotatedDataFrame(sc_metadata))
# 
# # 2. Create ExpressionSet for bulk data
# # count_ecfc is your bulk count matrix, meta_ecfc is your metadata
# bulk_eset <- ExpressionSet(assayData = as.matrix(count_ecfc),
#                            phenoData = AnnotatedDataFrame(meta_ecfc))
# 
# # 3. Run Deconvolution
# # Make sure the 'expertAnno.l1' and a subject/donor ID are columns in sc_metadata
# res <- BisqueRNA::ReferenceBasedDecomposition(
#   bulk.eset = bulk_eset,
#   sc.eset = sc_eset,
#   cell.types = "expertAnno.l1",
#   subject.names = "orig.ident" # Column with individual donor IDs in sc metadata
# )
# 
# # The results will be in res$bulk.props, showing the estimated
# # proportion of each brain cell type in your pure endothelial samples.
# # You'd expect one cell type to be ~1.0 and others to be ~0.
# # By combining your excellent exploratory analysis with one of these quantitative methods, you will have a very compelling and robust answer to your research question.
